					<h2>About the new NBS .VIRT extension</h2>
					<p>
						The .nbs format (Note Block Song) was created to work with Minecraft Note Block Studio, and
						contains data about how note blocks are laid out in the program to form a song. <br><br>This New
						file format can not be read just like a normal .NBS file as there is new header data to come with
						the new extension change<br><br>
						All the data types found in a .VIRT file are <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">hit with
							AES encryption</a>. Strings consist of a 32-bit integer, and then that many bytes for the
						characters. The problem with this is that the desktop software can not read this new file type with the encryption method, this wont actualy be a thing, it's a temp mesure to make sure that it works for now, file is made up of four parts, two of which are mandatory:
						But the Noteblock data has data that cant be normaly read with the software </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Header</li>
						<li>Note blocks</li>
						<li>Layers (Optional)</li>
						<li>Custom instruments (Optional)</li>
						<li>XYZ location data (Optional)</li>
						<li>opacity (Optional)</li>
						<li>Bightness (Optional)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						<span>If the information provided below differs from the old .nbs format, they are marked
						</span> <strong><span style="color: #01cc01c7">Green</span></strong>.

					<h2>NBS Changelog</h2>
					<div>
						<strong>Version 5:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>May now hold up to 240 custom instruments, previously 18.</li>
							<li>The path to custom sound files may contain slash characters, as a result of allowing
								custom sounds to be loaded from subfolders.</li>
							<li>No fields have been added or removed, so version 5 files may be read identically to
								version 4.</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Version 4:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Loop on/off, max loop count, and loop start tick are now saved.</li>
							<li>The program now saves which layers are locked.</li>
							<li>Note blocks now store velocity, panning, and pitch. These work in conjunction with layer
								volume and layer stereo.</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Version 3:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Song length is now saved again after the vanilla instrument count.</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Version 2:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Now stereo information is saved for each layer. This means that now the sound can pan to
								the left/right.</li>
							<li>For every layer, there's now a byte that determines how much that layer pans.<br>0 is 2
								blocks right, 100 is centre, 200 is 2 blocks left.</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Version 1:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>The first two bytes, which used to indicate the song length, have been changed to 0 to
								indicate the new format.</li>
							<li>The NBS version is now stored in the file.</li>
							<li>The byte after the NBS version is now the amount of vanilla instruments.<br>
								This change was necessary because, previously, the program didn't know when the custom
								instruments began. It always went up to 9, and everything after that was treated as a
								custom instrument.</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Classic (Version 0):</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>This version is used by the original Minecraft Note Block Studio, which precedes the
								transition to Open Note Block Studio. You can find the original specification <a
									href="https://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs/format" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

			<h2>Part 2: Note blocks</h2>
			<p>The next part contains the information about how the note blocks are placed in 3D space, what instruments
				they have how bright there texture is, how opacue the texture is, the colour data use to determine how
				much hue shift the texture is based on using hex codes for colour and what note. As you may know, the
				song is divided into ticks (horizontally) and layers (vertically). Often, a majority of the ticks and
				layers in the song are empty, which is why we specify the amount of "jumps" to the next active tick or
				layer, rather than just a bunch of empty slots.<br><br>
				The pattern of the note block format is mandatory for the new specifacation
				and it is as follows:</p>

				This part is optional. You can choose to stop writing here and the Note Block Studio will still load the

				Here the information about the layers are stored, which includes their name, volume and stereo. These

			<h2>Part 4: Custom instruments</h2>

				A song can have a maximum of <span class="newversion">18</span> custom instruments, each with a name and
